# Megaman Zero Unity
 
OBS: This is a project made by Matheus Godinho just for the sake of learning.

Welcome, this is a simple project where i try to imitate the mechanics of Megaman Zero. by now, we have him attack with the sword (air slash and 3 hits combo grounded), shoot, and have Zero dash (kinda of bugged by now) with wall slide, but no wall jump by now.
I will try to make at least the basic movimentation and a full stage here.
