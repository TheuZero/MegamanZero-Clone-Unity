# Megaman Zero Unity
 
This is a old project made by me just for the sake of learning. 

Welcome, this is a simple project where i try to imitate the mechanics of Megaman Zero. by now, we have him attack with the sword (air slash and 3 hits combo grounded), shoot, and have Zero dash with wall slide, with wall jump but kinda... not right.

Controls: AD or arrow for movement, "." for jump, "k" for dashing, "j" for sword, "l" for shooting. You can always change that in edit > project settings > input. Sword is labeled as Attack 1, shooting as Attack 2.
